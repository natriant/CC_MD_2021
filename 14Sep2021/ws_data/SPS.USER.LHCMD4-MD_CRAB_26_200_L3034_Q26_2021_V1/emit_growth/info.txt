The measurements for the emittance growth took place between 22h20 and 23h00.
This folder contains the measurements that are taken during this period.

From Hannes:
The feature of the “Best channel” from the wirescanner firmware does not work correctly yet.
We will always use PM1 (in fact we will set the wirescanners such that PM1 will be the best).

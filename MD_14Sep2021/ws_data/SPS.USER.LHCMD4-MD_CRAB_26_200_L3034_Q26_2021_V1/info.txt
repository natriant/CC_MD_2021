In the past, we used to adjust the gain parameter to obtain a good profile from the WS measurement.
The new WS of SPS have 4 different channels. The PM1 and PM2 stand for the 1 and 2 of those channels, as Photomultiplier 1 and Photomultiplier 2.

You can try to comapre the profils between PM1 and PM2 if they are saved in the parquet files.
